# DDPM_MNIST
A toy code for DDPM beginner learner
In this project, I mentioned some *background knowledge*, including (EMA, Positional Encoding, U-Net, etc.). Also, the code includes the whole process of ***DDPM*** (Denoising Diffusion Probablisitic Models) using *Pytorch*.
Users can run the codes in ***Google Colab***
